    <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
    <p>The website owned and operated by NEON BULB, S.L. (hereinafter "the website" or the "site") uses cookies and/or similar technologies that store and retrieve information when you browse. In general, these technologies can be used for a wide variety of purposes, such as, for example, recognizing you as a user, obtaining information about your browsing habits, or customizing the way content is displayed.</p>
    <p>The user can configure their browser to notify and reject the installation of cookies sent by the website, without this affecting the ability to access the contents of said website, but the quality of the website's operation may decrease.</p>
    <p>The specific uses we make of these technologies are described below.</p>

    <h2>What types of cookies are there?</h2>
    <p>Cookies, depending on their <strong>Permanence</strong>, can be divided into:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Session cookies:</strong> These are designed to collect and store data while the user accesses a web page. They are usually used to store information that is only of interest to keep for the provision of the requested service. They expire when the user closes the browser.</li>
        <li><strong>Persistent cookies:</strong> These are those in which the data is still stored in the terminal and can be accessed and processed for a defined period depending on when the purpose for which they are used is fulfilled (for example, so that the user remains identified in the Services) or when they are manually deleted.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Depending on their <strong>Owner</strong>, they can be divided into:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>First-party cookies:</strong> These are sent to the user's terminal equipment from a computer or domain managed by the editor itself and from which the service requested by the user is provided.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-party cookies:</strong> These are sent to the user's terminal equipment from a computer or domain that is not managed by the editor, but by another entity that processes the data obtained through the cookies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additionally, depending on their <strong>purpose</strong>, Cookies can be classified as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Technical cookies:</strong> These allow the user to navigate through a web page, platform or application and use the different options or services that exist in it.</li>
        <li><strong>Preference or personalization cookies:</strong> This type of Cookie remembers your preferences for the tools found in the services, so you do not have to reconfigure the service each time you visit.</li>
        <li><strong>Geo-location cookies:</strong> These Cookies are used to find out which country you are in when a service is requested. This Cookie is completely anonymous, and is only used to help orient the content to your location.</li>
        <li><strong>Registration cookies:</strong> They are generated once the user has registered or has subsequently opened their session, and are used to identify them in the services.</li>
        <li><strong>Analysis or measurement cookies:</strong> They are used to anonymously identify the visitor, count the number of visitors and their trend over time, and identify the most visited content.</li>
        <li><strong>Behavioral advertising cookies:</strong> They allow to expand the information of the ads shown to each anonymous user, storing the duration, frequency of display, or browsing patterns to form an advertising interest profile.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-party advertising cookies:</strong> Managed by third parties (“AdServers”) that can store Cookies sent from the Web Services.</li>
    </ul>
