    <h1>Products, Services, and Pricing Description</h1>
    <p>This document consolidates BUKKAKERY’s service offering and pricing structure, established as a Hybrid Subscription Network (SVOD + E-commerce) designed to deliver high-quality, niche premium content.</p>

    <h2>1. Focus, Positioning, and Aesthetic</h2>
    <p>BUKKAKERY specializes in niche genres with high loyalty potential: Bukkake and Group Sex (Gangbang). Our key differentiator is the high production quality (up to UHD 4K) and a premium, elite aesthetic, positioning us to offer an experience comparable to leading studios.</p>

    <h2>2. Primary Channel: Tiered Subscription (SVOD)</h2>
    <p>Our core business is subscription access to video-on-demand content, structured into tiered levels to maximize the value offered and enhance customer experience.</p>
    <h3>Access Levels and Monthly Pricing (Automatic Renewal)</h3>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Access Level</th>
                <th>Monthly Price (Recurring)</th>
                <th>Key Value Proposition</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>SILVER</strong></td>
                <td>€39.95 / month</td>
                <td>Unlimited VOD Catalog Streaming in 1080p quality and 24h Support.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>GOLD</strong></td>
                <td>€42.95 / month</td>
                <td>Includes SILVER, plus UHD 4K access, Premium Download, and full participation in Forums and Comments.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>PLATINUM</strong></td>
                <td>€46.45 / month</td>
                <td>Includes GOLD benefits, plus early access to Limited Edition Videos (15 days prior) and a 5% permanent discount in the Shop.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>DIAMOND</strong></td>
                <td>€54.96 / month</td>
                <td>The total VIP experience: Includes PLATINUM, plus Early Download Access, access to Exclusive Diamond Videos, and an 8% discount in the Shop.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p><em>Pricing Note: The gradual increments between levels are designed to incentivize subscription upgrades (upsell).</em></p>

    <h2>3. The BUKKAKERY User Experience (Web Features)</h2>
    <p>To justify the premium subscription value, the platform offers functionalities that promote loyalty and retention:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Video Page (Hybrid Experience):</strong> The video player is complemented by a Related Product Dispenser that integrates the E-commerce Shop directly into the content consumption experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Dashboard and Retention:</strong> The user panel (My Account) is optimized for retention, showing progression statistics (Watched/Total Videos) and new alerts/messages as the main Call to Action, generating a sense of exclusivity (FOMO).</li>
        <li><strong>Comments and Gallery:</strong> Photo Gallery access is available to non-logged users, while the Comments feature is active by default for GOLD members and above, fostering social interaction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Secondary Channel: Segregated E-commerce (Shop)</h2>
    <p>The model aims to convert subscribers into buyers, leveraging progressive discounts from the PLATINUM/DIAMOND tiers. To mitigate financial risk, the E-commerce is strictly segregated by product profile:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>High-Risk Products:</strong> Toys, collectibles, and specific adult-related items. Managed via the Main Domain (High-Risk Processor).</li>
        <li><strong>Low-Risk Merchandise:</strong> Apparel, branded accessories. Managed via a Separate Subdomain/URL (Low-Risk Processor), which reduces the overall financial risk of the company.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Additional Channels and Network Strategy</h2>
    <p>BUKKAKERY's future vision is to establish itself as a Content Network. The current web architecture includes functionalities prepared to monetize traffic through other avenues:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Affiliate Program:</strong> Implementation of a management and commission tracking module to monetize third-party traffic.</li>
        <li><strong>Live Cams Integration:</strong> The architecture is prepared for the integration of live cams, enabling partnerships with platforms like cambuilder.com.</li>
        <li><strong>Network Expansion (Channels/Deals):</strong> The navigation bar is designed to aggregate future partnerships and monetize third-party content via an aggregator model, similar to large-scale platforms (Amazon Prime Video style).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Changes to Terms of Service</h2>
    <p>Please note that these Terms of Service may change. The user will be notified in advance of any changes, in case they wish to cancel the service or modify their subscription accordingly. Changes will be made to improve services or adapt them to the supply chain.</p>
